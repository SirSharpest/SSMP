#Super Simple Music Player

This is a really small, very basic music player that I wrote as I was 
unhappy with all the alternatives. 

- I wanted something quick to load
- Could play any media file (I own)
- Would be cross compatible (Unix, Windows, Android, OS X)
- Could remember places in my audiobooks across system restarts

The aim of this music player is to acomplish all of the above goals. So 
far this is still in development and it simply plays music and (badly) 
scans and loads a music library on Unix systems
